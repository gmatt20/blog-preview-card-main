## Overview

### The challenge

My challenge is to build out this blog preview card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- CSS Box Mode
- Hover selector
- Display
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I am learning to use much less resources when I am figuring out code. I have been able to solve most problems by myself but it would take longer to figure out. However, I do not mind the extra time and effort because I know that it goes a long way. 

I had difficulties with CSS and styling as usual. My main issues were having everything aligned perfectly. I have used the div element multiple times which has helped. I am particularly concerned about CSS layout and aligning code. I have coded so that it is perfectly precise. This form of code is very particular, and I want to ideally make them general rather than specific. 

Otherwise, I have spent about 3 hours making the replica. I am very proud of it because I have used very minimal help and I have been able to solve most problems on my own! I have also sat down and completed this project in one sitting. which is a record for me. I enjoyed the process, even though I got frustrated along the way. But, I persisted, and look at what I did!

Here are some snippets of code that I am extremely proud of:

CSS

main, footer, .image{
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    padding: 20px;
    font-family: figtree;
    font-weight: 500;
}

I am proud of this code because I was able to use all of the declarations for 3 big elements. Because of this code, everything has been able to ideally be aligned (for the most part) and have a consistent font.

### Continued development

I want to continue my layouts and aligning in CSS. Again, I want to improve my skills in CSS so I can make awesome looking websites! The looks is where I am difficulties at the moment. I will channeling more energy, effort, and attention towards making particular code into general code so that I do not overengineer. 

### Useful resources
